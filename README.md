# eCommerce-US-API-Python --> Forked

This is a fork of the official Moneris Python API repo.  The official repo is not maintained regularly, and it seems like Moneris doesn't care enough about documenting its web API.

It's unclear to me why anyone even uses Moneris at all, but since we have to deal with it, we might as well produce some work that will help others who have to suffer the same fate.
